## mattrab

Codebase of Ask Mattrab app before 2nd beta release. Current codebase of realtime app is way more complex than this, but this is where it started from. :)

This is my first application developed with Ruby on Rails. Thank you Matt Sir for helping and inspiring me to gear up with this. The application is live @ askmattrab.com
